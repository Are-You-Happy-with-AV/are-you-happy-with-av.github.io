     This talk presents recent advances in understanding and supporting human attentiveness in vehicle lane-keeping automation. First, we introduce a personalizable, physics-based model that quantifies individual drivers’ expected attentiveness under varying driving conditions. The model formulates cognitive load as a function of vehicle speed and road curvature and leverages intuitive, gaze-derived indicators that provide greater interpretability than conventional metrics and allow for driver-specific customization. Using a high-fidelity driving simulator and an eye-tracking system, we integrated objective gaze data with subjective ratings via the NASA Task Load Index to optimize model parameters and validate predictive performance through human subject experiments. The model enables estimation of whether a driver is under-, over-, or appropriately attentive, supporting human-centric vehicle automation.
Complementing this modeling perspective, we also explore the role of visual communication in shaping driver-vehicle collaboration. Visual displays are widely used in vehicle automation systems to convey the vehicle’s perception of the environment to drivers and passengers, but the effect of communication detail on human workload, engagement, and acceptance remains underexplored. To address this, we conducted a pilot study in a driving simulator to assess how varying levels of detail in visual communication impact drivers. Both objective and subjective evaluations were performed, showing good agreement across assessment methods. Together, these studies highlight how quantifying driver attentiveness and systematically designing visual communication can jointly advance safe, effective, and human-centered lane-keeping automation.

     The importance of enhancing motion comfort in vehicles has been growing with the rapid development of automated vehicles and the increasing use of in-vehicle digital devices. Understanding human motion comfort requires a quantitative framework of self-motion perception, including motion sickness under various motion exposures such as vehicle dynamics. In this talk, I will provide an overview of recent research on modeling motion sickness and self-motion perception based on the Subjective Vertical Mismatch Theory, which has attracted increasing attention in recent years. Furthermore, I will present applications of these computational models to the study of motion perception and comfort in vehicles, including automated vehicles.

    <div style="padding:15px; border-radius:10px; font-size:14px; line-height:1.33;">
    Autonomous driving (AD) is advancing rapidly. By leveraging state-of-the-art sensing, decision-making, and control technologies, the most advanced AD features currently available are capable of providing assistance close to SAE Level 3 on complex and congested urban roads (some manufacturers refer to this as Navigate on Autopilot, or NOA). However, given the diversity and unpredictability of driver and passenger needs, there is still a long way to go before fully trustworthy and satisfactory AD functions can be achieved. This talk focuses on personalized demands of drivers and passengers in terms of safety, comfort, and traffic efficiency, presenting our explorations in decision-making, motion planning, and motion control. The discussion includes research on personalized decision-making tailored to drivers' style preferences and motion sickness-aware motion planning considering passenger comfort.

    <div style="padding:15px; border-radius:10px; font-size:14px; line-height:1.33;">
    With the rapid advancement of autonomous driving technology, the communication and interaction design of external display interfaces has become a critical factor in ensuring traffic safety and enhancing human–vehicle coexistence. External displays are not only required to convey the vehicle’s intentions and status but also to provide pedestrians, cyclists, and other road users with clear and intuitive safety warnings. This talk focuses on the design of interactive safety warning information for external display interfaces in autonomous vehicles, addressing the functional positioning and interaction logic of such interfaces, the content and visual representation of safety information (including color, symbols, and dynamic cues), the application of multimodal interaction and context-awareness, and the validation of design effectiveness through user experiments and simulation studies. Building on theoretical analysis and case studies, the report proposes an AI-driven, scalable, and psychologically grounded design framework to support both the social acceptance and traffic safety of autonomous vehicles.

   In this talk, I will present our recent research in several areas of autonomous driving (AD). I will begin with our latest multimodal end-to-end models, VADv2 and DiffusionDrive. Next, I will introduce RAD, a closed-loop, interactive reinforcement fine-tuning framework based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. Then, I will share our work on incorporating language modalities into AD. This includes Senna, a dual-system vision-language-action model, and AlphaDrive, a planning-oriented VLM based on RL and reasoning. Finally, I will outline our vision for future directions in driving-oriented VLAs and interactive driving enabled by language-based instructions.

   This presentation will introduce IXAI — a generative automotive styling design framework based on Inception Convolution and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). The method integrates multimodal data processing, Inception Convolution-based target detection, and Grad-CAM visualization to achieve efficient, transparent, and highly accurate styling generation. Based on this framework, we have developed a creative tool, IXAI-CAR, capable of rapidly generating high-quality automotive styling design images. Experimental results show that the method achieves an accuracy of 98.3% and improves the SSIM image quality metric by 8.24%, significantly outperforming traditional approaches. The study demonstrates that IXAI not only optimizes the design process and output quality but also provides an efficient and transparent solution for human-computer collaboration in complex design tasks, advancing the application and development of intelligent design tools in the automotive styling domain.

     Autonomous and connected vehicles are redefining mobility, yet their reliance on machine perception and large-scale data collection introduces new security and privacy challenges. This talk introduces a series of our recent studies addressing these challenges from both technical and human perspectives. We first introduce Shadow Hack, an adversarial attack that manipulates naturally occurring object shadows in LiDAR point clouds to deceive object detection models. By optimizing shadow geometry and materials, Shadow Hack achieves near-perfect attack success, while our proposed BB-Validator defense provides complete mitigation. We then present the Adversarial Retroreflective Patch (ARP), a stealthy nighttime attack on traffic sign recognition that activates only under headlight illumination. ARP achieves over 93% attack success in physical environments, and our user study shows that participants perceived ARP-modified signs as nearly natural (average score 2.04 vs. 1.81 for benign signs), whereas conventional patch attacks were easily detected (≥3.69). We also explore privacy perceptions in connected vehicles through large-scale user surveys, revealing that sensitivity depends strongly on data type and user role. Biometric, audio, and visual data evoke the greatest concern, while drivers show higher tolerance than passengers and pedestrians. These findings highlight the importance of transparency and role-aware data practices for trustworthy autonomous mobility.
