    <h6>Abstract</h6>
    <p>
In recent years, autonomous driving systems have been applied not only to cars but also to smaller robotic mobility platforms, such as Autonomous Personal Mobility Vehicles (APMVs). These autonomous vehicles (AVs) frequently encounter pedestrians during automated driving, especially APMVs, which are typically used in sidewalks and other shared spaces. To enhance the interaction experience between pedestrians and autonomous vehicles (AVs) and to reduce potential risks, it is essential to investigate pedestrians’ walking behaviors in such encounters and to understand the underlying psychological processes. In this talk, I will first introduce a study that investigates the causal relationships between pedestrians’ subjective feelings and their walking behaviors during interactions with an APMV equipped with an external human–machine interface (eHMI). Based on the causal factors identified in this study, I will then present an approach for improving pedestrian–autonomous car interactions.

  <!-- Abstract -->
  <div style="margin-top:16px;font-size:16px;line-height:1.2">
    <h6>Abstract</h6>
    <p>
Autonomous Driving (AD) vehicles still struggle to exhibit human-like behavior and socially interaction awareness in highly dynamic and interactive traffic scenarios. The key challenge lies in AD’s limited ability to interact with surrounding vehicles due to a lack of understanding of the underlying social interaction mechanisms. To address this issue, MPCFormer is introduced, which is an interpretable data-driven approach for socially-aware autonomous driving. To the best of the knowledge, MPCFormer is the first to explicitly model the dynamics of social interaction mechanism between vehicles. A novel interpretable data-driven modeling paradigm is introduced to ensure modeling interpretability. Afterwards, a socially-aware Transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture learns the social interaction dynamics from natural driving data. By integrating the learned social interaction dynamics into motion planning, the AD can proactively interact with surrounding vehicles. The planning safety is guaranteed by social interaction mechanism awareness and the safety constraints. Open-looped evaluation demonstrates that with the socially-aware capability, MPCFormer achieves the lowest trajectory prediction errors, from ADE@1s (0.12m) to ADE@5s (0.86m). Close-looped evaluation confirms the modeling interpretability of MPCFormer. Meanwhile, MPCFormer achieves the best planning success rate of 94.67%, improves driving efficiency by 15.75%, and saves lane change distance by 49.01%.

    <p>
The importance of enhancing motion comfort in vehicles has been growing with the rapid development of automated vehicles and the increasing use of in-vehicle digital devices. Understanding human motion comfort requires a quantitative framework of self-motion perception, including motion sickness under various motion exposures such as vehicle dynamics. In this talk, I will provide an overview of recent research on modeling motion sickness and self-motion perception based on the Subjective Vertical Mismatch Theory, which has attracted increasing attention in recent years. Furthermore, I will present applications of these computational models to the study of motion perception and comfort in vehicles, including automated vehicles.

  <!-- Abstract -->
  <div style="margin-top:16px;font-size:16px;line-height:1.2">
    <h6>Abstract</h6>
    <p>
With the rapid advancement of autonomous driving technology, the communication and interaction design of external display interfaces has become a critical factor in ensuring traffic safety and enhancing human–vehicle coexistence. External displays are not only required to convey the vehicle’s intentions and status but also to provide pedestrians, cyclists, and other road users with clear and intuitive safety warnings. This talk focuses on the design of interactive safety warning information for external display interfaces in autonomous vehicles, addressing the functional positioning and interaction logic of such interfaces, the content and visual representation of safety information (including color, symbols, and dynamic cues), the application of multimodal interaction and context-awareness, and the validation of design effectiveness through user experiments and simulation studies. Building on theoretical analysis and case studies, the report proposes an AI-driven, scalable, and psychologically grounded design framework to support both the social acceptance and traffic safety of autonomous vehicles.

    <h6>Abstract</h6>
    <p>
This presentation will introduce IXAI — a generative automotive styling design framework based on Inception Convolution and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). The method integrates multimodal data processing, Inception Convolution-based target detection, and Grad-CAM visualization to achieve efficient, transparent, and highly accurate styling generation. Based on this framework, we have developed a creative tool, IXAI-CAR, capable of rapidly generating high-quality automotive styling design images. Experimental results show that the method achieves an accuracy of 98.3% and improves the SSIM image quality metric by 8.24%, significantly outperforming traditional approaches. The study demonstrates that IXAI not only optimizes the design process and output quality but also provides an efficient and transparent solution for human-computer collaboration in complex design tasks, advancing the application and development of intelligent design tools in the automotive styling domain.

  <!-- Abstract -->
  <div style="margin-top:16px;font-size:16px;line-height:1.2">
    <h6>Abstract</h6>
    <p>
In this talk, I will present our recent research in several areas of autonomous driving (AD). I will begin with our latest multimodal end-to-end models, VADv2 and DiffusionDrive. Next, I will introduce RAD, a closed-loop, interactive reinforcement fine-tuning framework based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. Then, I will share our work on incorporating language modalities into AD. This includes Senna, a dual-system vision-language-action model, and AlphaDrive, a planning-oriented VLM based on RL and reasoning. Finally, I will outline our vision for future directions in driving-oriented VLAs and interactive driving enabled by language-based instructions.
