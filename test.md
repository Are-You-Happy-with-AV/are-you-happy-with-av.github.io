       Junmin Wang is the Fletcher Stuckey Pratt Chair in Engineering and a Professor in Mechanical Engineering at University of Texas at Austin. In 2008, he started his academic career at Ohio State University, where he founded the Vehicle Systems and Control Laboratory, was early promoted to Associate Professor in September 2013 and then very early promoted to Full Professor in June 2016. In 2018, he left Ohio State University and joined University of Texas at Austin as the Accenture Endowed Professor in Mechanical Engineering. Professor Wang has a wide range of research interests covering control, modeling, estimation, optimization, diagnosis, and AI for dynamical systems, especially for automotive, vehicle, transportation, mobility, human-automation, robotic, energy storage, and manufacturing applications. Prof. Wang’s research contributions include the development of control and estimation methods that advance efficiency, driving safety, and emission performance of conventional, electrified, connected and autonomous/automated vehicles. He has five years of full-time industrial research experience (2003-2008) at Southwest Research Institute (San Antonio, Texas) where he was a Senior Research Engineer and led research projects sponsored by more than 50 industrial companies and governmental agencies worldwide. Prof. Wang’s research programs at UT Austin and Ohio State University have been funded by federal agencies and industrial companies such as National Science Foundation (NSF), Office of Naval Research (ONR), Department of Energy (DOE), U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), Army Research Lab (ARL), Texas Department of Transportation, GM, Ford, Honda, Tenneco, Eaton, Ftech, Denso, and others.

  <div style="background:#f1f3f5; padding:15px; border-radius:10px; font-size:14px;">
   Autonomous Driving (AD) vehicles still struggle to exhibit human-like behavior and socially interaction awareness in highly dynamic and interactive traffic scenarios. The key challenge lies in AD’s limited ability to interact with surrounding vehicles due to a lack of understanding of the underlying social interaction mechanisms. To address this issue, MPCFormer is introduced, which is an interpretable data-driven approach for socially-aware autonomous driving. To the best of the knowledge, MPCFormer is the first to explicitly model the dynamics of social interaction mechanism between vehicles. A novel interpretable data-driven modeling paradigm is introduced to ensure modeling interpretability. Afterwards, a socially-aware Transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture learns the social interaction dynamics from natural driving data. By integrating the learned social interaction dynamics into motion planning, the AD can proactively interact with surrounding vehicles. The planning safety is guaranteed by social interaction mechanism awareness and the safety constraints. Open-looped evaluation demonstrates that with the socially-aware capability, MPCFormer achieves the lowest trajectory prediction errors, from ADE@1s (0.12m) to ADE@5s (0.86m). Close-looped evaluation confirms the modeling interpretability of MPCFormer. Meanwhile, MPCFormer achieves the best planning success rate of 94.67%, improves driving efficiency by 15.75%, and saves lane change distance by 49.01%.
