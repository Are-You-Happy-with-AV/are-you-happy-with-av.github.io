     Autonomous Driving (AD) vehicles still struggle to exhibit human-like behavior and socially interaction awareness in highly dynamic and interactive traffic scenarios. The key challenge lies in AD’s limited ability to interact with surrounding vehicles due to a lack of understanding of the underlying social interaction mechanisms. To address this issue, MPCFormer is introduced, which is an interpretable data-driven approach for socially-aware autonomous driving. To the best of the knowledge, MPCFormer is the first to explicitly model the dynamics of social interaction mechanism between vehicles. A novel interpretable data-driven modeling paradigm is introduced to ensure modeling interpretability. Afterwards, a socially-aware Transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture learns the social interaction dynamics from natural driving data. By integrating the learned social interaction dynamics into motion planning, the AD can proactively interact with surrounding vehicles. The planning safety is guaranteed by social interaction mechanism awareness and the safety constraints. Open-looped evaluation demonstrates that with the socially-aware capability, MPCFormer achieves the lowest trajectory prediction errors, from ADE@1s (0.12m) to ADE@5s (0.86m). Close-looped evaluation confirms the modeling interpretability of MPCFormer. Meanwhile, MPCFormer achieves the best planning success rate of 94.67%, improves driving efficiency by 15.75%, and saves lane change distance by 49.01%.

     The importance of enhancing motion comfort in vehicles has been growing with the rapid development of automated vehicles and the increasing use of in-vehicle digital devices. Understanding human motion comfort requires a quantitative framework of self-motion perception, including motion sickness under various motion exposures such as vehicle dynamics. In this talk, I will provide an overview of recent research on modeling motion sickness and self-motion perception based on the Subjective Vertical Mismatch Theory, which has attracted increasing attention in recent years. Furthermore, I will present applications of these computational models to the study of motion perception and comfort in vehicles, including automated vehicles.

    Autonomous driving (AD) is advancing rapidly. By leveraging state-of-the-art sensing, decision-making, and control technologies, the most advanced AD features currently available are capable of providing assistance close to SAE Level 3 on complex and congested urban roads (some manufacturers refer to this as Navigate on Autopilot, or NOA). However, given the diversity and unpredictability of driver and passenger needs, there is still a long way to go before fully trustworthy and satisfactory AD functions can be achieved. This talk focuses on personalized demands of drivers and passengers in terms of safety, comfort, and traffic efficiency, presenting our explorations in decision-making, motion planning, and motion control. The discussion includes research on personalized decision-making tailored to drivers' style preferences and motion sickness-aware motion planning considering passenger comfort.

    With the rapid advancement of autonomous driving technology, the communication and interaction design of external display interfaces has become a critical factor in ensuring traffic safety and enhancing human–vehicle coexistence. External displays are not only required to convey the vehicle’s intentions and status but also to provide pedestrians, cyclists, and other road users with clear and intuitive safety warnings. This talk focuses on the design of interactive safety warning information for external display interfaces in autonomous vehicles, addressing the functional positioning and interaction logic of such interfaces, the content and visual representation of safety information (including color, symbols, and dynamic cues), the application of multimodal interaction and context-awareness, and the validation of design effectiveness through user experiments and simulation studies. Building on theoretical analysis and case studies, the report proposes an AI-driven, scalable, and psychologically grounded design framework to support both the social acceptance and traffic safety of autonomous vehicles.
